# Identify 2-3 changes that can be made to our environment to prevent an ssh brute force attack from the internet.

1. WebAppSG security group SSh rule should narrow the Source IP to certain IPs instead of accepting request from everywhere. Delete "All traffic" inbound rule.
2. Set up AWS WAF to create a Rate-based rule to defend against brute-force attack.
3. Set up a Bastion Host, change SSh rule from WebAppSG security group to only allow Bastion Host access. 

# Neither instance should have had access to the secret recipes bucket, in the even that instance API credentials were compromised how could we have prevented access to sensitive data.

Delete the Role c3-app-InstanceRole-xxxxx that were assigned to both instances immediately, or modify the policy to only allow S3 access to the free-recipes bucket.
